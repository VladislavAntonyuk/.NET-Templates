<MudText GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-4">
	By downloading or using the app, these terms will
	automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
	that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
	allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
	our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
	extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
	to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
	versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
	database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
	to it, still belong to Vladislav Antonyuk.
</MudText>
<MudText GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-4">
	Vladislav Antonyuk is committed to ensuring that the app is
	as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
	reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
	its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
	charge you for the app or its services without making it very
	clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
</MudText>
<MudText GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-4">
	The @Constants.ProductName app stores and processes personal data that
	you have provided to us, to provide my
	Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
	access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
	not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
	removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
	official operating system of your device. It could make your
	phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
	compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
	that the @Constants.ProductName app won’t work properly or at all.

	You should be aware that there are certain things that
	Vladislav Antonyuk will not take responsibility for. Certain
	functions of the app will require the app to have an active
	internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
	by your mobile network provider, but Vladislav Antonyuk
	cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
	functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
	have any of your data allowance left.
</MudText>
<MudText GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-4">
	If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
	should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
	mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
	be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
	the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
	other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
	responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
	charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
	(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
	you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
	using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
	received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
</MudText>
<MudText GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-4">
	Along the same lines, Vladislav Antonyuk cannot always take
	responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
	make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
	battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
	Vladislav Antonyuk cannot accept responsibility.
</MudText>
<MudText GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-4">
	With respect to Vladislav Antonyuk’s responsibility for your
	use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
	bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
	updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
	to provide information to us so that we can make it available
	to you. Vladislav Antonyuk accepts no liability for any
	loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
	relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
</MudText>
<MudText GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-4">
	At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
	currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the
	both systems(and for any additional systems we
	decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
	and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
	using the app. Vladislav Antonyuk does not promise that it
	will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
	and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
	installed on your device. However, you promise to always
	accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
	also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
	it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
	Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
	rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
	(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
	from your device.
